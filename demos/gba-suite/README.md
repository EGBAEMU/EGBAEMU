# GBA Suite
A Game Boy Advance test suite.

## Usage
Each ROM contains multiple tests. Either all of them pass or the number of the first failed one is displayed on the screen (background mode 4 is required). You can reference the source code for the expected result. Feel free to open an issue if something is unclear.
